hTron
=====
Description
-----------
The hTron is a three-terminal superconducting device consisting of a normal heater directly over a superconducting meander. Its input is low impedance while its output is high impedance, and it has very good input-output isolation. These features make it ideal for transducing ~millivolt signals into ~Volt signals, forming a superconductor-to-semiconductor interface.

Characteristics
---------------
The basic in-out response is shown in :numref:`response`. There is a threshold power where the heat generated on the input resistor is enough to raise the temperature of the underlying meander, turning it normal.
