W-center LED
============
Description
-----------
W-centers are emissive centers in silicon produced by ion bombardment. By putting them in a PN junction in a waveguide, the W-centers can be excited electrically. This is the principle underlying the waveguide-coupled all-silicon light-emitting diode (LED) developed in :cite:`Buckley:17`.

Characteristics
---------------
The light-current (LI) and current-voltage (IV) curves of a previous LED are pictured here. Optical intensity is measured in clicks per second from an on-chip single photon detector.

The W-centers emit around 1220nm. The spectrum of the emitted light under different biasing conditions is shown here
